Masters of Renaissance is the final test of the teaching: "Software Engineering", course of the "Computer Science Degree" held at Politecnico di Milano during the Academic Year 2020/2021. <br>
This is a turn based Board Game where you are in the shoes of a Florence citizen and your goal is to collect and invest resources. You can take resources from the Market, use resources to buy cards that will help you to get more resource through productions, advance in the faithpath and activate special power thanks to Leader Cards.
You can play with your friends in a max of 4 players match or, if you don't have any, play a Singleplayer game against Lorenzo Il Magnifico! <br>
Have fun with this Strategic Game! :octocat:
